== Differences from prawn-layout 0.7

- Colspan and rowspan are not yet supported.

- Floating-point calculation of column widths is handled differently than in
  0.7. In prawn-layout 0.7, column widths were calculated by rounding up to
  the nearest integral PDF point. In the refactor, exact widths are honored
  (up to floating-point error), but cell bounding boxes have one point added
  to their width and height to compensate for floating-point roundoff error.

  For example, given two columns, each of width 12.5 pt with no cell
  padding, the table width would be 25.0 pt (in 0.7, it would be 13 + 13 =
  26 pt). The first cell bounding box is anchored at x=0 and is 13.5 pt
  wide; the second bounding box is anchored at x=12.5 and is 13.5 pt wide.
