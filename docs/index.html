          <p>
            The recommended way to read Prawn's documentation is to view it locally on your own machine.
            You can do this by cloning our git repositories, by unpacking your gems, or by running
            a gem server.  Online documentation can be out of date, or may be written against
            a version that you are not actually running on your machine.  Local documentation is much
            less likely to lead you astray.
          </p>
          <h2>For Lazy People</h2>
            We do have some documentation online, but it's really only meant to
            be a convenience for those who don't understand how to get local documentation 
            working properly.  Please don't complain if it is out of date.

            <h3>Prawn 0.11.1</h3>
            <p>
              This is the most recent gem version of Prawn, released 2011-04-03.</p>

              <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.11.1/Prawn.html">Prawn
              0.11.1 API docs</a>
            

          <h2>Recommended Approach</h2>
          <p>
            RubyGems includes with it a server for hosting gems, which also can host up
            documentation.  To use it, just run:
          </p>
          <pre>gem server</pre>
          <p>
            Point your browser at http://localhost:8808 and you'll find an index of all installed
            gems, including Prawn.   If this doesn't work or you prefer not to run a gem server,
            follow the manual instructions below.
          </p>
          <h2>Manually building docs for Prawn 0.11.1:</h2>
          <p>
            To get the source, you can clone
            <a href='http://github.com/sandal/prawn/tree/0.11.1'>sandal/prawn</a>
            from Github, or you can unpack the gem like this:
          </p>
          <pre>gem unpack prawn</pre>
          <p>
            Once you have the source, you can run the following command in the
            project directory to generate your documentation:</p>
            <pre>rdoc lib/</pre>

          <p>
