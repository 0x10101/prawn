          <p>
            The recommended way to read Prawn's documentation is to view it locally on your own machine.
            You can do this by cloning our git repositories, by unpacking your gems, or by running
            a gem server.  Online documentation can be out of date, or may be written against
            a version that you are not actually running on your machine.  Local documentation is much
            less likely to lead you astray.
          </p>
          <h2>For Lazy People</h2>
            We do have some documentation online, but it's really only meant to
            be a convenience for those who don't understand how to get local documentation 
            working properly.  Please don't complain if it is out of date.

            <h3>Prawn 0.8.4</h3>
            <p>
              This is the most recent gem version of Prawn, but is actually
              quite out of date.  Users should be trying our development
              snapshots to prepare for Prawn 1.0.   However, since a lot of
              folks likely have 0.8 code in production, we support it still.</p>

              <p>Prawn 0.8 is split out into three packages 
              <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.8.4/prawn-core">prawn-core</a>,
              <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.8.4/prawn-layout">prawn-layout</a>, and 
              <a href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.8.4/prawn-security">prawn-security</a></p>

              <p>This is a confusing situation that has been resolved in our
              development snapshots, but if in doubt, look in prawn-layout for
              table stuff, and in prawn-core for almost everything else.<p>

            <h3>Prawn 0.10.2</h3>

            This is the latest development snapshot as of 2010.06.30.  Because we merged
            prawn-core, prawn-layout, and prawn-security, all of your
            documentation is finally in one place.  <a
              href="http://prawn.majesticseacreature.com/docs/0.10.2">View the 0.10.2 API docs
              here.</a>
            

          <h2>Recommended Approach</h2>
          <p>
            RubyGems includes with it a server for hosting gems, which also can host up
            documentation.  To use it, just run:
          </p>
          <pre>gem server</pre>
          <p>
            Point your browser at http://localhost:8808 and you'll find an index of all installed
            gems, including Prawn.   If this doesn't work or you prefer not to run a gem server,
            follow the manual instructions below.
          </p>
          <h2>Manually building docs for Prawn 0.8.4:</h2>
          <p>
            To get the source, you can clone the
            <a
              href='http://github.com/sandal/prawn/tree/0.8.4'>sandal/prawn</a>, 
            <a href='http://github.com/sandal/prawn-layout/tree/0.8.4'>sandal/prawn-layout</a>
            and
            <a href='http://github.com/madriska/prawn-security/tree/0.8.3'>madriska/prawn-security</a>
            repositories from Github, or you can unpack your gems like this:
          </p>
          <pre>
  gem unpack prawn-core
  gem unpack prawn-layout
  gem unpack prawn-security</pre>
          <p>
            Once you have the source, you can run the following command in each
            project directory to generate your documentation:</p>
            
          <pre>rdoc lib/</pre>

          <p>

          <h2>Manually building docs for Prawn 0.9+:</h2>

          <p>The development snapshots of Prawn (currently 0.10.2 at the time of
          writing, are distributed via git-only.  The good news is that
          prawn-core, prawn-layout, and prawn-security have all been merged
          into a single repository.  The bad news is that we don't necessarily
          guarantee the documentation will be up to date or complete between now
          and 1.0.</p>

          <p>However, you are still encouraged to manually build docs as needed,
          and the approach used for 0.8.4 will work for later versions of Prawn
          as well.  Should you build your own gem, you only need to unpack the
          <tt>prawn</tt> gem to get at the source for the whole library.
          Otherwise, checkout whichever tag matches the version of Prawn you're
          using and follow the 0.8.4 instructions.</p>
        <h2>Having Problems?</h2>

        <p>If you are having trouble getting the docs to build, think you've
        spotted an error in our documentation, or want to contribute
        documentation patches, please contact us on the Prawn mailing list.
        Improving documentation is a top-priority for us on our path to
        1.0, and as you can see, it's an area where we could really use
        some help.</p>
