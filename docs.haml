            The recommended way to read Prawn's documentation is to view it locally on your own machine.
            You can do this by cloning our git repositories, by unpacking your gems, or by running
            a gem server.  Online documentation can be out of date, or may be written against 
            a version that you are not actually running on your machine.  Local documentation is much
            less likely to lead you astray.


          %h2 Recommended Approach

          %p 
            RubyGems includes with it a server for hosting gems, which also can host up
            documentation.  To use it, just run:

          %pre
            gem server

          %p 
            Point your browser at http://localhost:8808 and you'll find an index of all installed
            gems, including Prawn.   If this doesn't work or you prefer not to run a gem server,
            follow the manual instructions below.

          %h2 Manual building for Prawn 0.8.4:

          %p 
            To get the source, you can clone the 
            %a{:href => "http://github.com/sandal/prawn/tree/0.8.4"} sandal/prawn, 
            %a{:href => "http://github.com/sandal/prawn-layout/tree/0.8.4"} sandal/prawn-layout
            and 
            %a{:href => "http://github.com/madriska/prawn-security/tree/0.8.3"} madriska/prawn-security
            repositories from Github, or you can unpack your gems like this:
         
          %pre
            gem unpack prawn-core
            gem unpack prawn-layout
            gem unpack prawn-security
