1. Bug reports are welcome, but please make sure to include a minimal code sample that
shows your problem.

2. For all support requests and feature requests, please use the [Prawn mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prawn-ruby) instead of the Github tracker.

3. Pull requests for bug fixes or enhancements are welcome. Feel free to open
them in the early stages of your work so that we can give feedback
and discuss ideas together.

Please note that Prawn has had a rough couple of years, and so our forward
progress has slowed down quite a bit. To make it to a 1.0 release, we need
to work on just the most essential things, but our long-term goal is to
make this project as friendly to contributors as possible.
