          Generating printable documents can be ridiculously hard, but it doesn't have to be.  
          What we really need is not another special purpose application or kitchen-sink library, 
          but a hackable platform instead.
        %p
          Prawn provides a super high level API for sorts of things that everyone implementing 
          printable documents will need.   With the tools we provide, you'll be able to cut 
          through basic PDF generation tasks with ease.  But how about when things get 
          interesting and require some custom functionality?  Well, that's where Prawn thrives.

        %p
          Just beneath the surface, you'll find a comprehensive extension API 
          that lets you leverage the full range of possibilities that the robust PDF format 
          affords you.  We also expose every bit of tooling that we've used to implement 
          Prawn's core functionality, all of which you can add to or change in any way 
          you'd like.  Rather than making loads of assumptions about your needs, we provide you 
          with the raw materials to roll your own tools.

            %p Getting started with Prawn can be as simple as:
            %p
              require 'prawn'
              %br
              Prawn::Document.generate('hello.pdf') do |pdf|
              %br
              &nbsp;&nbsp;pdf.text("Hello Prawn!")
              %br
              end

            Our goal is to bring the sort of modularity and aggressive code re-use 
            found in web development to the printable document problem space.
