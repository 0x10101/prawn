# Prawn supports two different methods for drawing both lines and curves.
#
# line_to and curve_to set the drawing path from the current drawing position
# to the specified point. The initial drawing position can be set with move_to.
# They are useful when you want to chain successive calls because the drawing
# position is set to the specified point afterwards.
#
# line and curve set the drawing path between the two specified points.
#
# Both curve methods define a Bezier curve bounded by two aditional points
# provided as the :bounds param
#
