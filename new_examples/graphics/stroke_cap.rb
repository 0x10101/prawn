# The cap style defines how the edge of a line or curve will be drawn. There are
# three types: :butt (the default), :round and :projecting_square
#
# The difference is better seen with need thicker lines. With :butt lines
# are drawn starting and ending at the exact points provided. With both :round
# and :projecting_square the line is projected beyond the start and end points.
#
# Just like line_width this method needs an explicit receiver to work.
