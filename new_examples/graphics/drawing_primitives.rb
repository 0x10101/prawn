# There are two drawing primitives on Prawn: line_to and curve_to
# 
# curve_to draws a Bezier curve according to the :bounds param
# 
# Both of them require require a drawing position to be initially set with
# move_to
# 
# The following code sets the initial drawing position, defines some lines
# and curves and them strokes the path
