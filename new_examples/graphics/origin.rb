# One important point when using Prawn is where the origin is placed on the
# page.
# 
# Pdf documents have the origin [0,0] on the bottom left corner of the page.
# 
# Bounding Boxes have the property of relocating the origin to its relative
# bottom left corner. So the origin of the page is the bottom left corner
# of the margin box.
# 
# The following snippet strokes a circle on the margin box origin
# 
# Then strokes the boundaries of a bounding box and a circle on its origin
# 
require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), '..', 'example_helper.rb')

Prawn::Example.generate('origin.pdf') do
  stroke_circle_at [0, 0], :radius => 10
  bounding_box [100, 300], :width => 300, :height => 200 do
    stroke_bounds
    stroke_circle_at [0, 0], :radius => 10
  end
end
